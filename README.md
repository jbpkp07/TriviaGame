This is a simple Trivia Game, with some unique styling to model what it would look like to write with chalk on a chalkboard.

It was written in HTML/CSS/Javascript/JQuery, and features a call to a Trivia API to consume JSON objects that represent trivia questions.

You can choose a category and a difficulty.

See how much you know!
